### 2. Adding a Category 

> Follow these steps for creating categories for image thumbnails too.

> Skip these steps if a category already exists for your Preset.

1. At the top of this page, press the button that says "Create new file."
2. In the field that says "Name your file...". Type in the name of the category.
3. Type a forward slash `"/"`. This will tell Git to treat the name as a folder.
4. After the slash. Type "readme.md".
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page (leave the contents blank).
6. Make sure the checkbox is set to "Create a __new branch__ ..."
7. Press the `Propose new file` button to get to the next page.
8. Press the `Create pull request` button.

This will notify me of a new category. Now all you need to do is wait for it
to be approved!

### 2. Adding Presets.

1. Scroll to the top of the page and select the `category` you want to add files to.
2. Select the button that says `Upload Files`.
3. Prepare your preset files...
    * Presets should be named following the naming convention (`Author_Description.json`).
    * Don't forget the .json file extension!
    * For example...

```
    djmonkey_Cafe.json
    djmonkey_Dome.json
    djmonkey_Food.json
    djmonkey_Pilon.json
    djmonkey_Store.json
```

6. Make sure the checkbox is set to "Create a __new branch__ ..."
7. Press the `Propose changes` button to get to the next page.
8. Press the `Create pull request` button.

This will notify me of the new presets. Now all you need to do is wait for it
to be approved!

If you haven't followed the naming guide lines then I may ask you to try again.
